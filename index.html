            <p class="text-justify mb-2">
                This next section includes a <strong>PDF resource</strong> that can help you prepare
                for each of your classes before term begins. It also provides some tasks for you to
                consider doing both before each week begins and after you have completed the week’s
                content.<br /><br />Completing this <strong>checklist</strong> for each of your courses
                will help you make connections between lecture content and other materials. This can
                be especially helpful as course content may be presented in different ways in each of
                your courses. Expectations for how you participate each week may also differ between
                courses and instructors. This means <strong>your plan for each class will look different.
                </strong> This checklist can help you to organize yourself to accomplish the various
                tasks each week in a way that helps you to learn and remember course content.<br /><br />
                Take a few minutes to <strong>review the checklist</strong> and consider the following
                questions before moving onto the next section:

                <ul>
                    <li>Have you considered any of the termly tasks yet? Do you know the answers to each of these questions? If not, who can you ask?</li>
                    <li>How do the weekly before and after checklists resemble or differ from how you organized your learning in high school?</li>
                    <li class="mb-5">What changes will you need to make so that you are learning most effectively this fall?</li>
                </ul>
